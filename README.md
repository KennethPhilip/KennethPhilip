- ⚡ Fun fact: ...The color blue is one of the most popular choices in design because of its universal appeal and calming effect. Interestingly, it's also been found that blue can increase productivity, which is why it's commonly used in offices and workspaces. This connection to productivity and focus makes blue a go-to color for many designers when creating work environments or tech-related designs.
